services: # For each service we need to tell docker how to build image for that service. 
  # frontend:
  backend: 
    build: ./ # This is where we have our Dockerfile (for backend)
    ports: # For port mappings 
      - 3000:8080 
    environment: # To set env variables 
      # - DB_URL=mongodb://db/testdb # Alternate syntax 
      DB_URL: mongodb://database/testdb 
      # "database" in url will be mapped to database container's ip address inside the Docker Network.

    # volumes: # For publishing changes in development. Host directoy can be mapped to container directory here 
        # - ./server:/app/server 
        # No need for $(pwd), can use . for current directory. 

    # will override default command in Dockerfile 
    # command: echo hello && npm start

    # command can also run shell scripts (usually entrypoint scripts)    
    # command: ./docker-entrypoint.sh 
    command: sh docker-entrypoint.sh 
    # This can be used for waiting until DB is initialized before starting server.

    # For DB we won't create a new Image, we pull one instead. 
    image: mysql:8.0
    ports:

  # Images build above can be reused for testing 
  backend-test: # Will reuse backend image 
    image: dockerized-rest-db-service_backend 
    # image names are prefixed with directory name by default. 
    command: go test  

# Volumes need to be defined first
volumes:
  testdb: # no value is needed. This is correct syntax

# TO build images that need building (eg. only backend in this file)
# > docker-compose build

# Check if images created 
# > docker images 

# Image names are prefixed with name of the directory where docker-compose.yml is located.

# To start all containers
# > docker-compose up 

# If any image is not build at this time, docker-compose up will automatically build it. 
# This will also download any image that needs pulled (eg. only mysql in this file)

# To force rebuild 
# > docker-compose up --build

# To bring down containers (stop and remove)
# > docker-compose down 

# This will not delete any Volumes. Check with 
# > docker volume ls

# Remove volume with:
# > docker volume rm my_volume

# DOCKER NETWORKING #############
# docker-compose automatically creates a network between all containers for communication. 

# To see these networks 
# > docker network ls

# Docker comes with an embedded DNS Server. 
# Each Container has a DNS resolver. DNS resolver asks DNS Server for container's ip address. 

# To ping one container from another (example for this file backend id 8e4)
# > docker exec -it 8e4 sh 
# $ ping database 
# OR 
# > docker exec -it -u root 8c5 sh 
# $ ping backend 

# To view logs across all containers in network 
# > docker-compose logs 

# This has same options (follow, timestamp) as docker logs. 
# > docker-compose logs -f -t
